              I am a motivated and dedicated third-year graduate student at Maharastra Institute of Technology, Pune. With my passion for technology and my growing curiosity, I am dedicated to exploring exciting projects such as network security, cloud architecture, and API development.

As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I am fascinated by the complex and ever-changing challenges of securing digital systems and networks. Through my learnings, I have developed a solid foundation in various security concepts and techniques, including threat intelligence, vulnerability assessment and response status.
I am constantly looking for new ways to improve my knowledge and skills to respond effectively to cyber attacks.

Additionally, I am passionate about exploring cloud architectures and their potential for innovation and scalability. I also remain interested in API development as I believe APIs are the backbone of modern software ecosystems.
I am interested in designing, building and integrating APIs, enabling efficient communication and data exchange between different applications and systems. I have experience with RESTful APIs, GraphQL and API security practices. These experiences strengthened my ability to work independently and in a team, while improving my problem solving and communication skills.
If you have similar interests or have an exciting opportunity, please contact me. Let's explore the possibilities and collaborate on new projects that push the boundaries of technology.
Call me to discuss cybersecurity, cloud architecture, API development or any related topic. I am always open to learning, discussing and exploring new opportunities.
